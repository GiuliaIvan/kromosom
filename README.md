# kromosom

Kromosom was the most complex exam group project that I've worked on, not only
because it was an exam, but because we had to deal with very sensitive content about the LGBTQ+ community.
Kromosom is an inclusion bar designed specifically for LGBTQ+ people, but also welcoming to all the others.
For this project, we made use of a lot of HTML, CSS & JavaScript as well as Adobe programes because it is
a very unique website that has everything designed by hand.

Check here their reaction when they saw the website:
