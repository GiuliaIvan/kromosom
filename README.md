# kromosom

Check the website: http://kromosom66.dk/

Kromosom was the most complex exam group project that I've worked on, not only
because it was an exam, but because we had to deal with very sensitive content about the LGBTQ+ community.
Kromosom is an inlusion bar designed specifically for LGBTQ+ people, but also welcoming to all the others.
For this project, we made use of a lot of HTML, CSS & JavaScript as well as Adobe programes because it is
a very unique website that has everything designed by hand.

!! In the end, the bar actually decided to use the website we programmed for them as their OFFICIAL WEBSITE !!
We even had a "release party" for the website - see it here on facaebook: https://fb.me/e/1YPM1miwG

Check here their reaction when they saw the website:
